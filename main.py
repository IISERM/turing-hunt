The Treasure Hunt will go on until you finish it. The first person to finish will win.
This is an individual game, but you can always team up with someone else.
But remember that they can hide things from you and win themselves.
You can use the internet.
Please remember that if you exit from this app (by pressing the X or by
shutting down your computer), you will HAVE to restart.
You can minimize this safely, however.
We suggest that you also keep a notepad window open to note down information.

Some clues may seem too technical, but they're generally straight forward.
Just search the internet. Clues may be from
- HTML and VERY SIMPLE Javascript
- Python. If you know what loops are, you are good to go
- Easy Science or math puzzles
- Some Science Trivia

USE THE INTERNET!

Go forth and do your best!'''
