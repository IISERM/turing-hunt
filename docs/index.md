# Turing Hunt

Roam the halls and roads of the campus without worrying about social distancing, ticket costs and endsems, looking for clues and solving puzzles to get a chance[ยน](#tc1) to have tea with eminent scientists!

We know that some people may not have a stable internet connection, so the whole game is offline. (The actual reason is that online games are harder to make, but lets go with the socially aware reason :P) You can however use the internet to solve the clues!

The event starts at **9pm on Saturday 20th June**. Play time should be around 3 hours.
_Those who cannot make it on that day can also play it at any later time_

Turing Club hopes to make this an annual event, much like other Treasure Hunts, so we'll keep adding features every year! We really hope that you all participate and make this a success!

## Download the game now

**PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE IS A BUG IN T POINT. DO NOT CHECK OUT THE "RED SEDAN" CLUE. IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR GAMEPLAY**

### Windows

1. Download the app from <https://github.com/IISERM/turing-hunt/releases/download/v1.0/Turing_Hunt_Windows.exe>
2. Double-Click the downloaded file to run it
   - In case Windows Defender warns about an unknown program running, do not worry. Simply click `advanced options` and then `Run anyway`
3. Enjoy!

### Linux

1. Update your machine to the newest versions
   - Usually `sudo _package manager_ update` followed by `sudo _package manager_ upgrade`
      - For Ubuntu (and derivatives), Debian and Derivatives - `sudo apt update` followed by `sudo apt upgrade`
2. Download the file according to your OS
   - Ubuntu 20.04, Kali(Updated to latest), openSUSE Tumbleweed - Use version 29 below
   - Debian - Use version 28 below
   - Ubuntu 18.04 - Use version 27 below. (And update your OS whenever you are free)
   - Others - Run `ldd --version` and use the highest version lower than the version displayed.
3. Install `python3-tk` using command line.
   - In Ubuntu, run `sudo apt install python3-tk -y`
   - _Technically, you just need `fontconfig-config` and `libxcb1`, but it is easier to just install python3-tk.
4. Idk if double clicking the file will work or not, but you can always run it from the command line. `cd path/to/file` and then `./filename`.
5. And FINALLY, Enjoy!

## Rules

- Though technically a single-player game, you can always play with your friends. This game is best served with a side of a video call with your friends.
- You are allowed to use the internet, but a constant internet connection is not necessary
- **You cannot save the game, so do not close the game during play, or you will have to start all over again**
- Game play is relatively easy.
  - Use `ls` or `search` to look around for clues and other helpful items
  - Use `goto location name` or `cd location name` to move to connecting locations
  - Use `map` to open up the map. _Note that as you collect more items, new locations open up!_
  - Use `pocket` to view a list of items collected. _This is very helpful if you get stuck._
- Some clues have an image component or a file that needs to be copied somewhere.
